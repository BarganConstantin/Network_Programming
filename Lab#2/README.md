# Lab 1: Chat Application using TCP 💬

A simple chat application built with C# and Socket programming. 🔌

## Description 📝

This console application allows users to communicate with each other through broadcast or send individual messages in private. Each user runs an application of type client-server at the same time and can handle multiple incoming messages. Each client can choose a username to identify themselves in the chat.

## Features 🌟

The Simple Chat Application will have the following features:

- Multiple users can connect to the chat application simultaneously 👥
- Users can send and receive messages in real-time ⏰
- Each user runs an application of type client-server at the same time to handle incoming messages 🔗
- Users can communicate through broadcast or send individual messages in private 🔒

## Installation 💾

1. Clone the repository 📦
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 🧰
3. Build the solution 🔨
4. Start the server by running the Server project 🚀
5. Start one or more clients by running the UDPClientServerChat project and entering a username 🚀

## Usage 📖

Once you have started one or more clients, you can begin communicating with each other. Simply type your message in the client console and press enter. You will be prompted to either broadcast your message or send it to a specific user. If you choose to send it to a specific user, a list of all known users will be displayed and you can choose who to send your message to.

## Conclusion 🎓

This lab was a great opportunity to learn and practice socket programming in C# using UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The Simple Chat Application we built allows multiple users to communicate in real-time through broadcast or private messages. Through this project, we gained valuable experience in handling incoming messages and sending/receiving messages over a network using UDP.

Overall, this lab provided us with practical skills and experience in building network applications using socket programming in C#. We hope that this project will be useful for others who are interested in learning more about network programming! 😊
