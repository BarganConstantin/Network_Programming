# Lab 6: Simple NTP Client Console App 🕰️

A simple console application that uses NTP protocol to fetch the time from NTP servers and displays the exact time for a given geographic zone in "GMT+X" or "GMT-X" format where X is a number from 0 to 11.

## Description 📝

This project is a console application that uses NTP (Network Time Protocol) to fetch the time from NTP servers and displays the exact time for a given geographic zone. The user will be asked to enter the geographic zone in "GMT+X" or "GMT-X" format, where X is a number from 0 to 11. The application will then use the NTP protocol to synchronize with NTP servers and calculate the exact time for the specified geographic zone.

## Features 🌟

The Simple NTP Client Console App will have the following features:

- Prompt the user to enter a geographic zone in "GMT+X" or "GMT-X" format 🌍: The application will prompt the user to enter the geographic zone in "GMT+X" or "GMT-X" format, where X is a number from 0 to 11.
- Fetch the time from NTP servers using the NTP protocol 🕰️: The application will use the NTP protocol to fetch the time from NTP servers and synchronize with them.
- Display the exact time for the specified geographic zone ⏰: The application will calculate the exact time for the specified geographic zone and display it in the console.

## Installation 💾

1. Clone the repository of the Simple NTP Client Console App 📦
2. Open the solution of the Simple NTP Client Console App in Visual Studio 🧰
3. Build and run the application to start the console app 🔨

## Usage 📖

Once you have started the console application, you can enter the geographic zone in "GMT+X" or "GMT-X" format when prompted by the application. The application will then fetch the time from NTP servers and display the exact time for the specified geographic zone in the console.

## Conclusion 🎓

This lab provided a practical experience in building a simple NTP client console application that uses the NTP protocol to fetch the time from NTP servers and display the exact time for a given geographic zone. Through this project, we gained knowledge and skills in working with NTP protocol and calculating time for different geographic zones. This application can be extended and customized to add more features such as displaying the time in different formats or supporting more geographic zones. We hope that this project will be helpful for others who are interested in learning more about NTP client programming in C# and working with time synchronization! 😊
