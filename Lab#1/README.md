# Lab 1: Chat Application using TCP 💬

A simple chat application built with C# and Socket programming. 🔌

## Description 📝

&ensp; &ensp; This application allows users to connect to a server and communicate with each other. The server can handle multiple clients and broadcast their messages to all other clients. Each client can choose a username to identify themselves in the chat.

## Features 🌟

The Simple Chat Application will have the following features:

- Multiple users can connect to the chat application simultaneously 👥
- Users can send and receive messages in real-time ⏰
- The server will manage the connections between users 🔗
- The client will have a simple GUI to interact with the chat application 💻

## Installation 💾

1. Clone the repository 📦
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 🧰
3. Build the solution 🔨
4. Start the server by running the Server project 🚀
5. Start one or more clients by running the Client project and entering a username 🚀

## Usage 📖

&ensp; &ensp; Once you have started the server and one or more clients, you can begin communicating with each other. Simply type your message in the client console and press enter. Your message will be broadcast to all other connected clients.

## Conclusion 🎓

&ensp; &ensp; This lab was a great opportunity to learn and practice socket programming in C#. The Simple Chat Application we built allows multiple users to connect and communicate in real-time. Through this project, we gained valuable experience in creating a server-client architecture, handling connections, and sending/receiving messages over a network using TCP.

&ensp; &ensp; TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a crucial protocol for reliable data transfer over the internet. Understanding TCP and socket programming is essential for developing network applications that can handle multiple connections and communicate efficiently.

&ensp; &ensp; Overall, this lab provided us with practical skills and experience in building network applications using socket programming in C#. We hope that this project will be useful for others who are interested in learning more about network programming! 😊
