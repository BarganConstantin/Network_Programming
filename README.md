# 🌐 Network Programming Labs

This repository contains my labs for the Network Programming course. The labs are written in C# and include exercises on building chat applications using TCP and other network protocols.

## Lab 1: Chat Application using TCP [🔗](https://github.com/BarganConstantin/Network_Programming/tree/main/Lab%231)

In this lab, I built a simple chat application using TCP protocol. The lab included the following requirements:

- Creation of two console applications: a server and a client 💻
- The client application will connect to the server 🤝
- The client application will ask the user to enter some text from the keyboard and send it to the server 💬
- The server application will display this message in its window and rebroadcast it to all connected clients (including the one that sent the original message) 📩
- Customers will be able to send as many messages as they want 🔄
