# Lab 5: Email Client Web Application in C# 📧

An email client web application built with C# using the MailKit library to interact with email servers using the POP3 and IMAP protocols. 🌐

## Description 📝

This project is a web application that serves as an email client to interact with email servers using the POP3 and IMAP protocols. The application can show the list of emails from the mailbox, download an email with attachments, send an email with text, and send an email with an attachment. The application uses the MailKit library to handle email-related operations.

## Features 🌟

The Email Client Web Application will have the following features:

- Show the list of emails from the mailbox using the POP3 protocol 📋: The application can connect to an email server using the POP3 protocol, fetch the list of emails from the mailbox, and display them in the web application.
- Show the list of emails from the mailbox using the IMAP protocol 📋: The application can connect to an email server using the IMAP protocol, fetch the list of emails from the mailbox, and display them in the web application.
- Download an email with attachments using the POP3 and IMAP protocol 📩: The application can download an email with attachments from the mailbox and display the email and its attachments in the web application.
- Send an email with text using the SMTP protocol 📤: The application can send an email with text using the SMTP protocol and display a success message in the web application.
- Send an email with an attachment using the SMTP protocol 📤📎: The application can send an email with an attachment using the SMTP protocol and display a success message in the web application.

## Installation 💾

1. Clone the repository of the Email Client Web Application 📦
2. Open the solution of the Email Client Web Application in Visual Studio 🧰
3. Build and run the application to start the web server 🔨

## Usage 📖

Once you have started the web application, you can use the web interface to interact with the email server and perform the various operations described above. You can view the list of emails in the mailbox, download an email with attachments, send an email with text, and send an email with an attachment.

## Conclusion 🎓

This lab provided a practical experience in building an email client web application in C# using the MailKit library to interact with email servers using the POP3 and IMAP protocols. Through this project, we gained knowledge and skills in handling email-related operations such as fetching emails, downloading emails with attachments, and sending emails with text and attachments. This application can be extended and customized to interact with any email server that follows the same protocols. We hope that this project will be helpful for others who are interested in learning more about email client programming in C# and working with email servers! 😊
